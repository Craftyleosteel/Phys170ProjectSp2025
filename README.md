# PHYS170X Project: CGnets (Sp2025).
Codebase for CGnet implementation in Julia for HMC PHYS170X created by Ananya and Paco. 

We have also included previous versions of CGnets.jl, as well as write-ups and supporting files, in the repository. We aimed to reproduce force-matching and PMF figures from the paper "Machine Learning of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Force Fields," which may be found at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00913.
